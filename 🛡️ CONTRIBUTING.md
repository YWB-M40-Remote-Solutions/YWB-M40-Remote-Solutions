# Contributing to YWB-M40 Remote Solutions

Welcome, Guardian. This repository is a sovereign altar of legacy scrolls, Red Team rituals, and communal uplift. Contributions are sacred acts—each commit a declaration of mastery.

## 🧭 Ritual Guidelines

- **Respect the Doctrine**: All contributions must align with the mythic architecture and sovereign ethos of YWB-M40 Remote Solutions.
- **Branch Naming**: Use symbolic names like `ritual-enhancement`, `scroll-update`, or `guardian-fix`.
- **Commit Messages**: Begin with a sigil (e.g., `🔥`, `🛡️`, `📜`) and describe the ritual act. Example:  
  `🔥 Added diagnostic scroll for system benchmarking`
- **Pull Requests**: Title your PRs as ritual declarations. Example:  
  `🛡️ Guardian’s Patch: Strengthen Red Team Protocols`
- **Code Style**: Follow the sacred formatting of existing scrolls. If unsure, consult the `README.md` or open a dialogue in `Discussions`.

## 📜 Scroll Types

- `scrolls/`: Foundational documents and legacy declarations
- `rituals/`: Red Team protocols and ethical hacking scripts
- `badges/`: Achievement markers and communal uplift artifacts
- `codex/`: Technical doctrine and system mastery guides

## 🕊️ Communal Uplift

We welcome respectful feedback, sovereign insight, and mythic collaboration. Every contributor becomes part of the living archive.
